                        <p>I am a PHP Laravel developer with over 5 years of experience working on complex application development. I am always passionate about various complex projects and look forward to learning new website development technologies.</p>

                        <p>I started my career as an Assistant Software engineer in June-2017 and I was working on JAVA language frameworks during that duration. I have gained detailed experience in database concepts with MySQL and OracleDB.</p>

                        <p>After that, I joined one Vadodara-based IT company as a Junior PHP developer and earned comprehensive knowledge of various website development concepts like designing the front end, API development, and extensive dataset management with Laravel, PHP, and CodeIgniter. I have handled a team of 2-3 juniors and client coordination as well. I won the Star Performer Award thrice for my outstanding performance during my tenure and obtained a promotion with many appraisals. I was a key employee of this organization.</p>

                        <p>I am very keen on database concepts and data structures. It always fascinates me to work with database queries and manage large datasets. I have worked on MySQL, MongoDB, OracleDB, and PostgreSQL. The database has always been my first love. I also enjoy various complexities faced during project development and that will always give me more opportunities to learn something new.</p>

                        <p>Feel free to send me a message if you would like to know more about me. I am always eager to hear from others and expand my network on LinkedIn or you can drop a message on <a href="mailto:swatipanchal64@gmail.com">swatipanchal64@gmail.com</a></p>

                        <p>Specialties: PHP, Laravel, CodeIgnitor, MySQL, MongoDB, OracleDB, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, ReactJS, API development, Payment Gateway Integrations, Third party services integrations, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Trello, Bitbucket, AWS Server handling, Postman, Team handling, and client communication</p>
